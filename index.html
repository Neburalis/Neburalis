    <p><strong>About me</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>I'm self-taught developer, I wrote my first program about 10 years ago. But despite this, my skills cannot be called high, but I am learning and trying to improve them.</li>
    <li>I don't have any big projects that I could write about here, but I do have ambitions, and maybe I'll be able to write something soon.</li>
    <li>I'm currently studying the backend. Django, fast api, PostgreSQL, sqLite and some more technologys.</li>
    <li>I mainly write in Python, but I also don't forbid myself from trying something new and exotic.</li>
    <li>Iâ€™m looking for help with ... I'm open to any help, you can always submit issues in any of my repos, or pull requests.</li>
    <li>If you have any questions for me, you can ask them <a href="https://github.com/Neburalis/Neburalis/issues">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Fun fact: I like translating documentation into my native language because firstly it improves my knowledge of English, and secondly I can help my compatriots.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>usually other people here list technologies they are familiar with, but I am familiar with a lot of technologies, but I wouldn't say I am very good at them, so you can look at it in my repositories (and evaluate my skills in this technology) or on the banner below</p>
